### Codeing Rule:
Break down web page elements into small components and define their inputs and outputs, then combine them like lego pieces.
- Use pinia to manage state (https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- Because not get icon in link: https://xd.adobe.com/view/cc7a0cdc-b425-4478-a7e8-5c38cc84ff2b-9929/, so I use https://www.figma.com/file/eKVsKukuv0rsw4u1P6isdn/Material-Icons-(Outlined)-(Copy)?node-id=5%3A0
- For other developers: Note that you need to specify the correct input and output for custom components
- I don't have enough time to do all the filters, so I just do "type" and "favorite"
